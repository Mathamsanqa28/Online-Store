# Online-Store 
In this project HTML and CSS are used to create an online store, and Javascript is used to add  background functionality
and animations that make the website pleasing to the eye. Building the website in VSC, tools such as **Beautify** were used 
to enhance the readability of Javascript. The application allows one to choose items on display add to the cart and see the
total amount due. Options to delete, increase and decrease number of items in cart are available.
